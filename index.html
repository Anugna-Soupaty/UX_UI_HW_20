                <h1>ANUGNA SOUPATY</h1>
                <p>I am currently working as a preschool teacher and am a self-learned arts/crafts designer designing paper crafts for my class students.</p>
                <p>My interest in design work and my educational background, holding a bachelor's degree, motivated me towards UX/UI designing. </p>
                <p>After exploring several options, I got an opportunity through Georgia Tech Boot camp to learn UX/UI designer courses. Given an opportunity,<br> I would like to expand my career with these new skills to prove myself in any industry.</p>

                     In all my projects I followed these five step problem solving process. 
                     Part of this process is Research which is important step before designing any apps or websites. 
                     I am excited to see how my design is going to be after getting some inputs from users. Especially 
                     personas are my favourite part. Finally so proud to see the output showing some solution to my users.

                    I can clearly see the mistakes in my first design but so proud of what I did and where I am now. 
                     This is my first group project mobile app sign-in page. we are group of four and desgined this app 
                     for users who is struggling to book events nearby. got some painpoints from interviews and tried to 
                     solve the problems in this Mobile app. This is the Lo-Fi prototype wireframe.

                 Above is my Group project 2, I am really happy to see my progress. we all worked 
                 as a team and build this Non-Porfit website of Respect ability app. From our 
                 Heuristic evaluation, respectability website scored moderately on Appearance/Aestheitc, 
                 poorly on content/content organisation as well as navigation. So we focused on those 
                 elements and desgined this website.
